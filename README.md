# Filer (v4.0.0-internal_beta)
A 'cloud' file-explorer in NodeJS that utilizes the disk-space on the host's machine to transfer or download files from the host machine.

## Note
-   When using this tool! Please note that the connecting device must be the on the same network as the host device. (Host is the one running this tool!)

## Changelog(s) (v4.0.0)
-	Instead of relying on response.write() for writing HTML. The site now uses EJS Templating for the front-end. (More reliable front-end solution)
-	Removed /test endpoint
-	Added a backend API. New endpoint: `/api/directory?d=(directory)`. This endpoint will return a JSON response containing the directory contents.
-	New layout (front-end)
	-	`[X]` - (Attempts to) Open the file in the browser
	-	`[FILE NAME]` - Open the directory (opening a directory on a file will return an error)
	-	`[â†“]` - Downloads the file (with the correct name)

## Bugs:
-	Some files (when trying to open) may download the file instead. (Persistent bug!)
-	Some files, when downloading will give a 'NotFound' error!

# Android support! (NEW!)
-   I have added support for Android and no root is needed.

# Memo(s)
## Why make this?
I wanted to create my own knock-off 'cloud' storage. So I created this! Any file placed within the root folder specified will be fully accesible to other devices on the same local network. For example: if I uploaded a .png file to the root folder. My phone can access the item if its on the same network connection as the host (my computer).
