# Tutorial
Yes, it may seem confusing at first, but I designed it in a way to mimick what humans instinct would do!

1.  Each column will have an icon, either a `folder` icon or a `file` icon followed by its file name. Awesome! So, a `folder` icon indicates a `folder` while a `file` icon indicates a `file`.
2.  Click the file name to either go into that directory (if it's a `folder`) or download the file (if it's a `file`).
3.  `/` brings you to the `root` folder (basically where you started off)
4.  `../` brings you a `step back`, meaning that it takes you to the directory before

## Voila! That is it, now have fun using Filer!
