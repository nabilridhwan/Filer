-   When using this program, Please note that the connecting device must be the on the same network as the host device. (Host is the one running this program!)

# Why make this?
I wanted to create my own knock-off 'cloud' storage. So I created this! Any file placed within the root folder specified will be fully accesible to other devices on the same local network. For example: if I uploaded a .png file to the root folder. My phone can access the item if its on the same network connection as the host (my computer).
