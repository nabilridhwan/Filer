Hey! Looks like you can see this file! (or not...)
Thanks for using Filer! I am glad people are using my tools!

Rest assured, none of your data is being logged to any of my servers.

However do note that this server is served over HTTP meaning that everything you do can be seen by hackers!\

My advise is for you to not store secret files inside here.

It is not my intention to create a 'backdoor' for people but I actually wanted to implement basic features before implementing security.

Your items can't be read when you end (or force-quit) the NodeJS application.

I hope to implement HTTPS into this application soon!

Regards,
Nabil
